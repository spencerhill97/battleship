# Battleship

This project was tough to build for me because it put all of my JavaScript learning together and need to be built with no frameworks. This is a user vs computer experience and is meant to be very understandable for the user. The user can place their ships anywhere they want and they only need to double click them to rotate them from vertical to horizontal and so forth. When the game is over a message will appear with who won the game and an option to play again.

This was the first project that I implemented testing on and it was a bit of a challenge! As frustrating as it was it definitely was a major help in implenting cleaner and safer code. As I implemented new features I was able to test the older code and make sure that the whole program was operating as it should. I appreciated the slow burn of writing tests first and I plan to implement this process on my projects going forward!
